Learn GeoJSON (and build cool collaborative datasets!)
=============

Learn GeoJSON is a project to learn about the GeoJSON data format using git, GitHub, and geojson.io. It can be taught as a standalone exercise, or can be used to build real live collaborative datasets! There are a few in here to get you started. (There are also slides for this tutorial, which you can find [here](http://lyzidiamond.com/learn-geojson/).)

The following sections are intended for absolute beginners. If you're an intermediate or advanced user, great! Skip to the section where you're having trouble or need instructions.
